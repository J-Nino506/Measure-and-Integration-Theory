# Measure-and-Integration-Theory

These are my typed up notes and homework assignments from Measure and Integration Theory at George Washington University (MATH 6421).

The textbook used for this class was Real Analysis by Halsey Royden (third edition).
The format for solutions in the homework is **X**.*Y* for Chapter **X** and Problem *y* from royden.
